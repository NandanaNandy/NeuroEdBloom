Automated Question Paper Processing and Analysis

Problem Description
Educational institutions generate numerous question papers across various subjects, semesters, and formats. Extracting structured information from these papers for efficient storage, querying, and analysis is a challenging task. The existing manual process is time-consuming, prone to errors, and lacks scalability.

NeuroEdBloom solves this problem by utilizing AI-based document processing techniques to automate the extraction of key information, including:

Subject and course details
Semester and internal test number
Course outcomes
Bloom's taxonomy knowledge levels (for Parts A, B, and C)
The processed data is stored in a structured database, enabling seamless querying and in-depth analysis to support academic planning and evaluation.

Features
Intelligent Document Processing (IDP): Automated processing of PDFs, images, and other document formats.
Bloom's Taxonomy Classification: Categorizes questions by knowledge levels.
Structured Data Output: Stores extracted data in a database for querying and reporting.
Scalability: Handles large volumes of question papers efficiently.
